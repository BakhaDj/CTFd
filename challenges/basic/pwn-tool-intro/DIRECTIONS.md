# PWN-TOOL Intro

## Category: Basics

There is a super useful module for scripting in Python called pwn-tools. Familiazire yourself with some of the documentation [here](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/). This exercise will be introducing you to its most basic functionality.

If you need a refresher on basic linux commands, now is the time!

There is a server running on port 5001.

1. Download pwn-tools (for brownie-points use a [virtuelenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html))
2. Connect to it using Python pwntools (hmmmm... maybe something "interactive" will help)
3. Once you are connected, **find** the flag on the server. (For your own sake don't do it manually)
